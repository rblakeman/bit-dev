Every web application needs data from the server. Data fetching allows you to connect app users and real data to create meaningful interactions.

In composable applications, you can leverage components for data-fetching to unify and simplify this experience across multiple teams and applications while keeping flexibility.

In this example quick start we’ll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components to show how data-fetching is just another component that can be combined with more components to create infinite app experiences.

Check out this sample app example to see component-driven data fetching in action. When you’re done exploring go ahead and dive into the example quickstart below.

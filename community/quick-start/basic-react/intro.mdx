Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Basic React Quick Start

In this example quick start we'll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components to build a basic React application you can later extend and add more components, features (front or backend!), and developers.
Check out this React app example to see component-driven development in action. When you're done exploring go ahead and dive into the example quickstart below.

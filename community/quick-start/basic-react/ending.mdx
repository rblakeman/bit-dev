## Composable React app

React lets you build apps in components which is great. But placing all these components in a monolith with one codebase, version, and build means you canâ€™t enjoy the powerful benefits of components and modularity.

In this example, we will show you how to create a simple React application that is composable and each component is independent and decoupled. Just like Lego, you can easily scale your application, add or remove components, modify anything, fix bugs and release per-component changes, mix and match technologies, and easily collaborate with others on the same app without competing over versions or having to work in the same codebase.

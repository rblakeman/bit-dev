#### Main file

The 'main file' property defines the main file of this component.
A component's main file exposes an API for other components to use. It makes the component's code more maintainable and comprehensible by providing a single entry point.

A `main` file will typically look like this, but may contain additional exports as needed:

```ts
export { Button } from './button';
export type { ButtonProps } from './button';
```

To learn more about this, see [Main file](https://bit.dev/docs/components/structure/component-main-file).

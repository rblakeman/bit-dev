# Create Components

A component is a reusable, independently source-controlled module, that is stored in [scopes](https://bit.dev/docs/scope/scope-overview) and maintained in [workspaces](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/workspace-overview).
Components enable a new software development strategy that can be used to complement monorepos and poly-repos, or replace them, altogether.

To create a component use one of the [available component templates](https://bit.dev/docs/dev-services/generator/generator-overview#component-templates):

<BitCreate />

Components can be of various types. Choose between a client-side component (React is being used here as an example) and a server-side component.

<ComponentTypeTabs />

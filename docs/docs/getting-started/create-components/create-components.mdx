# Create components

A component is a reusable, independently source-controlled module, that is stored in [scopes](https://bit.dev/docs/scope/scope-overview) and maintained in [workspaces](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/workspace-overview).
Components enable a new software development strategy that can be used to complement monorepos and poly-repos, or replace them, altogether.

To create a component use one of the [available component templates](https://bit.dev/docs/dev-services/generator/generator-overview#component-templates):

<BitCreate />

For example, the following creates a component named `apps/to-do` using Bit's React template. It sets `my-org.tasks` as its scope name.

<BitCreateWithExample />

The output is similar to the following:

<BitCreateOutput />

This component has a [**component ID**](https://bit.dev/docs/components/structure/component-id): **`my-org.tasks/apps/to-do`**. This ID consists of the component's scope name and component name.
Component IDs are used by workspaces and scopes to reference components.

This components also has a [**development environment**](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/dev-environments), or 'env'.
An env is a also a component. It provides this component with pre-defined configuration and a set of development tools such as a <Tooltip content={compiler} language="bash">compiler</Tooltip>, a <Tooltip content={tester} language="bash">tester</Tooltip>, a <Tooltip content={linter} language="bash">linter</Tooltip>, and more.
Envs can be of different types. This component was configured (by the 'react' template) to use the [React env](https://bit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/react-overview) (`teambit.react/react`).

## Component files

A component can be of different types. A NodeJS module, an Angular component, a CSS module, and so on.
Since this component was created by the react template, the generated files are for a React component.
These files include standard React implementation files, as well as development files that are handled by the different tools ('env services') the React env provides.

Head over to the workspace UI ([http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)), to further explore the component (run `bit start` to run the UI server).

## Component configuration and metadata

For a component to be independently consumable and maintainable, it must contain information regarding its dependencies, development tools, configurations, and more.
This information is constantly being re-calculated during development, and once the component is versioned, it is persisted in the component snapshots.

Our new component is already configured with the React env, as well as a set of core 'Bit aspects', which are a certain type of components that compose Bit.
The metadata of this component is the sum of data generated by these aspects (including the env).

To inspect a component's metadata and configuration run the following:

<BitShow />

For example, to inspect our new component, run:

<BitShowWithExample />

The output is similar to the following. **Click on the different sections** to learn more about each of them.

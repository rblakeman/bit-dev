### Create a new app component

Run the following to create a React app using a template:

<CreateReactApp />

The output displays the ID of the generated app (component):

<CreateReactAppOutput />

<ExpandReactAppDir />

The generated app component includes an [app plugin file](/apps/application-plugins) with a unique extension that is detected
by its corresponding [application-type](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/application-types) (see the `my-express-app.node-app.ts` file, in your app's directory). Use the app plugin
file to determine how it should be served, built and deployed.

Run the following using the app's component ID to make this app loadable by your workspace:

<UseReactApp />

The app's name, as configured in its plugin file, is `my-react-app`. Run the following to run this app locally (make sure to <InstallReactRouterDom>install 'react-router-dom'</InstallReactRouterDom> first, as it is a dependency of this app):

<RunReactApp />

The output displays the port used for serving that app:

<RunReactAppOutput />

:::info Deploying apps
React apps do not provide their own default deployer. To learn how to set a deployer see [App deployment](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/app-deployment).
To explore a demo React app configured with a deployer, see this [React app with Netlify deployer](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/netlify/react-app) or this [React app with Cloudflare deployer](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/cloudflare/react-app).

### Fork an app to your workspace

Search [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for an app component that best fits your needs, and fork it to your workspace. This will provide you with a new component that has much of its boilerplate written for you.

For example, run the following to fork the [apps/to-do](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do) React app to your workspace:

<ForkReactApp />

Run the following to make this app loadable by the workspace:

<UseForkedReactApp />

Run the following to run the app:

<RunForkedReactApp />

:::info Define an existing component as an app
To define an existing component as an app, add to its directory the necessary app plugin and entry file (use a plugin file the corresponds to the application-type you choose).

For example, the [previously created component](/getting-started/composing/creating-components), [`apps/to-do`](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do), requires [this plugin file](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do/~code/react-app.react-app.ts) and [this app root file](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do/~code/to-do.app-root.tsx) to be included in its component directory, for it to be defined as a react app.
Once these files are added, run the `bit use <app-component-id>` command, to make it loadable by your workspace.

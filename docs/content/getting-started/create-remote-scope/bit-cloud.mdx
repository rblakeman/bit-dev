import { LoginExample, LoginOutput } from './commands';

Bit uses [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) as its default hosting provider. To register or sign in from your terminal, run the following:

<LoginExample />

Once an account has been created successfully, your terminal will greet you with the following message:

<LoginOutput />

Now that you have set up your account and logged in, head over to the [create scope](https://bit.cloud/~create-scope) page to create a new scope.
Choose a name for your scope that describes the common purpose or functionality of your components.

## Set a scope as the workspace default scope

Now that you've created a remote scope on bit.cloud, verify that the `defaultScope` property in the `workspace.jsonc` config file, is set to the correct username/org and scope name.

```js
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    /* set a scope with this pattern: <username-or-org>.<scope-name> */
    "defaultScope": "my-org.tasks-scope"
  }
}
```

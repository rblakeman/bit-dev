Self hosting your own scope requires provisioning a dedicated container either locally, on Kubernetes, or any other cloud provider.
To learn more see, [Hosting scopes](/scope/running-a-scope-server).

## Set a scope as the workspace default scope

Now that you have set up a remote scope, verify that the `defaultScope` property in your `workspace.jsonc` config file, is set to the correct accuont and scope name.

Note that a single workspace can maintain components of different scopes. The `defaultScope` property defines the default configuration for components.
It does not limit components from using other scopes.

```js
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultScope": "tasks-scope"
  }
}
```

# Create a Remote Scope

Scope is a collaboration server for components. It is where components are exported to and imported from.
Scopes provide a Web UI and expose a GraphQL API. They can be extended and customized using Bit aspects.

Choose between hosting a scope on [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) (for free) and self-hosting:

<HostingScopeOptions />

The scope name is part of the component ID. When the scope name changes, the relevant component IDs change.
To reflect that change in the component package names, run the following:

<LinkExample />

:::info Maintaining components of different scopes in the same workspace
The `defaultScope` property defines the default scope name for components in that workspace.
However, components in the same workspace can be configured to use different scopes.

You can set a scope on a component (directly) when [creating a new component](/getting-started/composing/creating-components), or after a component was created:

<SetScopeExample />

<ExpandedScope />
:::

### Reset all components

Once a component is snapped, its scope name can no longer be changed. To reset all components (the exist only locally) back to their 'new' and un-versioned state, run:

<InitExample />

Alternatively, use the `scope` command shown above, to change the scope name while still retaining the components' history.

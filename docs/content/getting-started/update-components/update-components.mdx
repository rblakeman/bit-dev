# Update Components

A component's source of truth is not is any specific workspace but in its remote scope. When collaborating on components it may happen that a newer version is available for a component maintained in your workspace.

To get new snaps for components maintained in your workspace, run:

<ImportExample />

_Alternatively, run `bit install` to install the workspace dependencies and import new component snaps, in a single command._

The output lists all updated components. These updates are stored in the [local scope](/workspace/structure/local-scope). They are not checked-out to the working directory, yet.

<ImportOutputUpdated />

When collaborating on a workspace using VCS like git, it may happen that new components are added to the workspace (the `.bitmap` file, which is tracked by your VCS, has additional components registered):

<ImportOutputAdded />

> Components with pending updates are also listed when running `bit status`.

## Compare component snaps

To compare between two snaps, or between a snap and the component's local (un-snapped) changes, run:

<DiffExample />

<ExpandedDiff />

The following output lists the differences between the checked-out snap and the local changes.
Differences between versions can include dependencies and configuration, in addition to the component's source files.

<DiffOutput />

Alternatively, head over to the 'compare' tab in the UI (scope or workspace) to visually inspect changes:

<Image src={compare} />

## Checkout snaps to the working directory

To checkout a component's head (latest snaps) to the working directory, run the following:

<CheckoutHeadExample />

<ExpandedCheckout />

The output lists the component files that were updated by this checkout:

<CheckoutOutput />

### Handle merge conflict

In case Git is unable to automatically merge the incoming changes with local changes in your component, you get prompted to resolve the conflict.

Bit will print a similar output to this:

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/input/button to version 1.0.5
updated base-ui/input/button.spec.ts
updated base-ui/input/index.ts
CONFLICT base-ui/input/button.ts automatic merge failed. please fix conflicts manually and then tag the results.
```

You can use the several options when `checkout` to resolve conflicts.

- `--theirs` - the remote version overrides the local modifications.
- `--ours` - the local implementation overrides the remote changes.
- `--manual` - resolve the conflict manually.

```bash
bit checkout latest teambit.base-ui/button --ours
```

Once merge is resolved, run `bit status` and see the result.

```bash
bit status
```

```status
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > teambit.base-ui/input/button ... ok
```

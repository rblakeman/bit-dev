# Exporting components

Components are exported to remote scopes to make them available for other consumers and collaborators.
A component is decoupled from its workspace and ready to be exported (['staged'](/workspace/workspace-status)) when its latest changes are snapped.

Check your workspace status to review which snaps are ready to be exported:

<StatusExample />

The output lists the [previously-snapped component](/getting-started/collaborate/snap-component-changes), `apps/to-do` as 'staged':

<StatusOutput />

Run the following to export all staged components:

<ExportExample />

<ExpandedExport />

The output summarizes the number of exported components and their target remote scopes:

<ExportOutput />

## Viewing exported components

Exported components are hosted on their target remote scopes. Each remote scope stores the component versions and features a web UI similar to the workspace UI, in which all components are showcased.  
To see all exported components open your browser and navigate to the Bit scope URL.

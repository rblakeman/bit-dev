# Importing components

<!-- Note that a single workspace can maintain multiple components. This allows you to update changes across components, as if they were part of a single monolithic app, while still enjoying all the benefits of independent components. -->

For a component to be maintained and updated, it needs be imported from its remote scope into a workspace.

To import a component to a workspace, [copy its component ID from its remote scope](https://bit.cloud/teambit/design/info/icon-text), and run the following:

<ImportExample />

<ExpandedImport />

> To import and checkout a different snap, include its version (semver/hash) in the component ID. For example: `teambit.design/info/icon-text@0.0.7`.

The output notifies the component was imported successfully. Its source files were checked-out to the working directory and a package ([workspace component link](/workspace/structure/component-links)) was generated for it in the `node_modules` directory, for other components to consume:

<ImportOutput />

An imported component is maintained exactly like a component that was created in that workspace. It can be updated, snapped, and exported.

The following workspace shows the imported component (`info/icon-text`) being used by `apps/to-do`, which was [previously created in that workspace](<(/getting-started/composing/creating-components)>).
Any changes made to `info/icon-text` will affect its dependent component, `apps/to-do`.

Run `bit start` to explore the imported component in your workspace UI.

## Import a component's dependents

An imported component might have dependent components in various remote scopes.
Importing these dependents enables you to examine, locally, how changes made to their dependency will affect them. When the component (the dependency) is snapped, bit will auto-snap its dependents.

<ImportDependentsExample />

## Use a component as an external dependency

Run the following to stop maintaining a component in your workspace, and use is as an [external dependency](/dependencies/external-dependencies), instead:

<EjectExample />

<ExpandedEject />

The output notifies the component package was installed (and added to the workspace dependency policy), and the component's source files were removed:

<EjectOutput />

_To perform the reverse action, to maintain an external dependency ([an installed component](/getting-started/composing/use-dependencies)) in your workspace, import that component to your workspace. The installed package will be replaced by the component's workspace component link._

## Fork a component

Forking a component copies its source files and configuration to your workspace. This copy does not include the component's previous snaps as it is a ['new'](/workspace/workspace-status#new-components) component.
This can be useful when you want to introduce changes to a component but do not have `write` permissions in its remote scope. It's also useful when you need a component that is similar to an existing one, but different enough for it to be a different component.

<ForkExample />

<ExpandedFork />

# Using Dependencies

For a component to be composable and independent, it must maintain its own dependency graph. This graph can include packages, as well as other components.

To add a dependency to a component, include a standard `import`/`require` statement in any of its files. Bit will automatically detect these statements and include them in the component's dependency graph.

For example, the following adds the [`teambit.design/inputs/input-text`](https://bit.cloud/teambit/design/inputs/input-text) component as a dependency of (the previously-created) [`my-org.tasks-scope/apps/to-do`](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do?version=0.0.2) component:

```ts
import { InputText } from '@teambit/design.inputs.input-text';
```

<ExpandedCode />

Notice how this dependency is consumed as a standard package, even though it is a component.
This would be true even if that dependency was maintained in the same workspace. Bit makes this possible by generating a package for each component, during its development and during its build.

Consuming components via their (absolute) package name, makes them usable in any context, whether is is a different workspace or even a non-Bit project.

Run the following to install the dependency:

<InstallDependency />

:::info Installing components in non-Bit projects
You can install components using standard package managers like npm and Yarn, in Bit and non-Bit projects. To learn more, see [Installing components](/components/installing-components).
:::

Run the following to review the component's data:

<ShowTodo />

The output lists the above dependency as a direct dependency of 'apps/to-do':

<BitShowTodo />

To review the full dependency graph of a component, including its indirect dependencies, head over to the component's
'Dependencies' tab in the UI. Notice how this component has 2 additional indirect dependencies.

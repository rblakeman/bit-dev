## Getting started

Now that you have Bit installed, and your workspace is up and running it is time to start building with components.
Our design system is built out of the components you see below, click on each of them to get an explanation of what their responsebilities are, how to use them, and why we chose them.

## Our design system structure

This simple app showcases a few components from our design system, including theme which can be switched.
Components are kept decoupled from specific design, by being aware only of the Base Theme, agnostic of specific color implementation.

<!-- Using components as a consumer early on the development process helps avoid uncertainty and achieve faster and more accurate results. -->

Let's build a composable design-system, using components!

<!-- A Wiki app is a great way to share information and improve communication inside a team or an organization. Building
a Wiki in components means you get a better product while making it easier to collaborate and contribute. In fact, you can
add any feature or functionality to your Wiki by simply adding or extending components.

While creating this Wiki you'll learn how to install Bit, create a workspace, and build a Wiki by composing components.
You can later use these (and more) components to build anything you can imagine. We will also use this example to walk you through the thought process that goes into building composable software.

Before we start,
check out this example of our own Team's composable Wiki. It includes components from different teams in our organization.
Take a look and let's start! -->

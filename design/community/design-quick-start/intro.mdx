Let's build a composable design-system, using components!

Design Systems are a powerful way to achieve UI/UX consistency, strengthen you brand, and breed collaboration between team members and even across teams.

Composability and components are the lifeblood of the modern design system. With Bit, some of the best teams create a thriving component economy with adoption and collaboration across the organization.

In this example quick start we`ll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components from our own design components to kick-start your composable component system.

We`ll see how components and composability can unlock powerful benefits such as making it easy to build and distribute components, adopt and customize components, collaborate and contribute to components, and use scalable and simple workflows for theming design tokens, and more.

Check out this sample app example to see a composable design system in action. Click the toggler on the upper right corner to see our dark theme.
When you`re done exploring go ahead and dive into the example quickstart below.

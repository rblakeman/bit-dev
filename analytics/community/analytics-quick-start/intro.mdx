Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Analytics Quick Start

<!-- During this quick start, you will learn to create your own **composable analytics dashboard**. We will show you how simple it is to build even a complex app like an analytics dashboard made from components! -->

In this example quick start we'll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components from our basic Team Bit analytics dashboard to kickstart your own composable data analytics experience.
Check out this sample dashboard with mock data to see component-driven analytics in action, then start creating your own experience!

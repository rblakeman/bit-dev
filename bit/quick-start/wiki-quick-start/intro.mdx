Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Wiki Quick Start

In this example quick start we'll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components to build a Wiki app.
A Wiki app is a great way to share information and improve communication inside a team or an organization.
Check out this sample wiki to see a component-driven wiki in action, then start creating your own wiki!

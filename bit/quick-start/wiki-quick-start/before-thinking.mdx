## Getting started

Now that you have Bit installed, and your workspace is up and running it is time to start building with components.
Our Wiki is built out of the components you see below, click on each of them to get an explanation of what their responsebilities are, how to use them, and why we chose them.

## Picking the first component

As you start to build with components, remember - **Choosing the first component is an important step in the process**.
When choosing the first comopnent, focus on choosing the most tangible component, the one you can ideally use now.
In this example - if we had a content content piece, we could not use it at this point, so we start with the App, since we can use that.

<!-- Using components as a consumer early on the development process helps avoid uncertainty and achieve faster and more accurate results. -->
